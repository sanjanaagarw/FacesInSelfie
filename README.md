FacesInSelfie
=============

In this project we have used Instagram API and programming languages like python, R (for visulization)

The purpose of this project is to Find a survey and visulize it using various graphs and plots.

The survey is to find number of faces in an selfie Image.


First Step:
=============

Download images using Instagram API tagged with "selfie"

See downloadimage.py file

urllib library is used for downloading images 

Second Step:
=============

from command line:

python making_csv.py haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml

This will create a csv file, have a look at "test.csv" file

Third Step:
=============

Now using R programming and different visualisation techniques, 

we have plotted pie chart and graphs.

Some observations:    
     
1. Mostly there is only one face.    

2. There are cases when people just tag "selfie" without even a face in it.    

3. Maximum number of faces detected were 19.

Thank you, hope you liked the survey!
